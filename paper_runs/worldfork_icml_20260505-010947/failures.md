# Failures and Open Risks

## Current Blockers

- The default host ports `8003/5433/6379` were already occupied by a separate `main-work` WorldFork stack. This run uses an isolated `worldfork-icml` compose project on `18045/15445/16445`.
- Four resolution-source URLs did not fetch cleanly in automated verification: Oscars returned 403, Reuters returned 401, and two Paramount IR URLs timed out. These need manual/source-redundancy review before final card QA is treated as complete.

## Not Yet Complete

- E1 initialization screen on 108 public cards. A single smoke case (`resolved_003`) completed successfully in 146.20 seconds.
- E2 direct baselines on 24 resolved cards.
- E3 WorldFork short resolved no-branch and branching runs.
- E4 long-horizon audit runs.
- E5 social-state/emotion audit.
- Optional social ablation and branch-threshold sweep.

## Fixed During This Run

- Parameterized compose host ports with default-preserving `WORLDFORK_API_PORT`, `WORLDFORK_POSTGRES_PORT`, and `WORLDFORK_REDIS_PORT`.
- Removed two lingering hidden-file legacy provider example lines from `.env.example`.
- Fixed `/api/jobs/workers` and `/api/jobs/queues` observability by importing the Celery app module instead of the package-exported Celery object.
